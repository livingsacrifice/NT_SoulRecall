Bible memorization aide

You can download this app by searching 'NT Soul Recall' on the Play Store.

#Introduction

This app was designed for personal use as an offline scripture memorization aide. Included translations are KJV, NKJV, NIV, NASB, HCSB, and RVR1960 (Spanish). The program defaults to using only KJV for New Testament only. You can add the Old Testament from the settings menu. To access other translations, go to the database menu, select preferred translation and click on 'Cache selected version.' If you prefer to view the words of a verse before the reference, check 'Reverse Mode' in settings menu.

#Learning Scripture

##Storing Verses You can add verses to your memory database by clicking on '+ Verse' for the selected verse or '+ Chap' for an entire chapter. If you are not sure of where to start, you can pick a short book to work through (I recommend James, Philippians or 1 John) or you can press 'VotD' to pull up a random verse from a predetermined list (and then +Verse if it's one you want to work on).

##Learning Verses When learning verses, you should switch verse sequence from 'Increment' to 'MyVerses' (this will change verse navigation to randomly select a verse from your memory database using selected translation), as well as turning off 'Reverse Mode' in settings if you had it enabled. Optionally, you can select the 'Hint' check box to show the first 5 (default #, can be changed in settings) words of a verse before showing the rest of it. Then select 'FlashCards' from menu to hide UI and only show verse/reference.

##Navigating with Gestures

Check mark - draw a check mark if you correctly remember the verse
Caret - draw a caret (upside down V) if you do not remember the verse.
Swipe left - swipe from right to left to go to next verse. This does not score the verse.
Swipe right -swipe from left to right to go back one verse.
Hot edges - touching the left or right 5% of the screen will also navigate forward/backward without swiping.
Mid section - touching the middle of the verse will toggle between reference, verse, and hint (if selected).
##Reviewing progress Select the 'Info' button from the menu to review your progress. It will show how many verses saved for the selected translation and calculate a 'GPA' for how well you know them. By default, a verse will move up one letter grade from E/F to A each time you correctly remember a verse. If you mark a verse incorrect, the grade will depend on ratio of how frequently you struggle with that verse. 'MyVerses' navigation will weight the trouble verses more heavily when choosing the next verse to show you.

#Searching the Bible While not directly related to memorizing scripture, I did add a search function for when you know what verse you want to learn but are not sure where it's found. You can access this by selecting 'Search' from the menu. Searching will only work on translations that you have cached using the database menu. Default settings will search all translations for verses that use every word you enter into the text box. You can change search parameters to look for verses that have any of the words, all of the words, or that exact phrase. You can click an entry from the list of results to go straight there on the main page, where you can add it to your verse list, if desired.
